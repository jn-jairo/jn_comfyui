# It matches the package/class that calls the function model_management.get_torch_device() on the custom node.
# Example, if it's called at foo.bar.MyCustomNode, any of these will work:
# extension_device:
#   foo: cpu
#   foo.bar: cpu
#   foo.bar.MyCustomNode: cpu

# extension_device:
#   comfyui_controlnet_aux: cpu
#   jn_comfyui.nodes.facerestore: cpu
#   jn_comfyui.extra.facelib : cpu
